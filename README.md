# Interactive_Menu
An "animated" menu in C++, simple, usefull and user friendly. The target of this project is to be very simple in order to be easy to implement any other projects within it. Also I couldn't let the menu empty and I made the first usecase of it implementing a casual "Snake" game and an "Offline GPS" for the Romanian citties.
